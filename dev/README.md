# integer_net Magento 2 Module Template

To automatically replace all placeholders with custom values, run the following script:

```
dev/init
```

It runs interactively and tries to present you sensible default variables based on your repository.


To learn about additional options, run `dev/init --help`. 

**The `dev/` directory can be removed after initialization!**

## Placeholders explained

| Placeholder    | Purpose |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Magento Repo Public Key | Used for `auth.json` so that composer install works with repo.magento.com. See https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html how to obtain keys. <br>âš  **The keys will be visible, so do not use an account used for commerce license or marketplace extensions!** |

## Magento Compatibility

You are asked which Magento versions you want so support. Based on the answer, version constraints for `php` and `magento/framework` are initialized in `composer.json`, and test jobs generated in `.travis.yml`. Feel free to change those later, for example if you don't want to support older PHP versions.

# Developing the template

### Adding placeholders

To add new placeholders, adjust the initialization script config in `dev/src/Config.php`

Files where placeholders are replaced are defined in `getFilesToUpdate()`, placeholders with their default values in `getDefaultVariables()`

### Adding or removing a new Magento version

When new Magento versions should be added to the template or support for old ones dropped, the following changes are necessary:

- In `dev/src/Config.php`, change `getMagentoVersions()`, where Magento versions are defined together with their PHP and framework version constraints.
- In `dev/src/TravisJob.php` change the constants `LATEST_MAGENTO_VERSION` and `DEV_BRANCH_JOBS` to define the current develop branch of Magento.
